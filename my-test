You are a business systems analyst specialized in COBOL systems.

Your task is to extract and summarize **only the business logic** from the COBOL code provided below.

**Strict Instructions**:
- Do NOT include or quote any COBOL code, syntax, or variable names in the output.
- Focus only on business intent, rules, and behavior explained in plain English.

Extract:
- Conditional logic (decisions made, and why)
- Loops (what is being repeated and why)
- Computations (what is calculated and its purpose)

Use this output format:

### Extracted Business Logic

#### 1. Conditional Logic
- **Rule**: [What decision is made]
- **Purpose**: [Why itâ€™s done in business terms]

#### 2. Loops and Iterations
- **Loop**: [What is being iterated]
- **Purpose**: [Business reasoning for looping]

#### 3. Computations and Transformations
