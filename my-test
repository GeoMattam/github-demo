You are a senior enterprise software analyst specialized in COBOL systems.

Your task is to analyze the following COBOL program and **extract only the business logic**. 
Focus on interpreting the business intent behind control structures (e.g., IF conditions, PERFORM loops, GO TOs) 
and any computations or data transformations. 

**Do not include any code in the output.**

Clearly describe:
- The **conditions (IF-ELSE, EVALUATE)** and their **business purpose**
- The **iteration logic (PERFORM loops, GO TO loops)** and their role in business workflows
- Any **calculations or transformations** and their intended business meaning

Use a **structured markdown format** as follows:

### Extracted Business Logic

#### 1. Conditional Logic
- **Condition**: [Summarized logic]
- **Purpose**: [Business rule being enforced]

#### 2. Loops and Iterations
- **Loop**: [Loop type and bounds]
- **Purpose**: [Why the iteration exists in the business context]

#### 3. Computations and Data Transformations
- **Computation**: [Summary]
- **Purpose**: [Business outcome or metric being calculated]
