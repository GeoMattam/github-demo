You are an expert software engineer. Your task is to read the given Java code and convert it into **exhaustive, line-by-line pseudocode**.

Please ensure:
- All control flow (if-else, loops, switches) is fully explained in natural language.
- All method calls are expanded with a description of their purpose.
- Variable declarations and assignments are explained.
- Any object creation or data structure manipulation is described.
- The pseudocode should be easy to follow by someone without Java knowledge.
- Do not include any Java syntax in the output. This must be **pure pseudocode** in plain English.

Java Program:
----------------------------------------------------
```java
<insert_java_code_here>

Expected Output:
Pseudocode:
1. Start the program.
2. Declare a variable X and initialize it to ...
3. Define a function named calculateSum that accepts two integers.
  - Inside this function:
      a. Add the two input numbers.
      b. Return the result.
4. Call the calculateSum function with values A and B and store the result in variable total.
5. If total is greater than 100:
    - Print "High".
    - Else:
      - Print "Low".
6. End the program.

Please output only the pseudocode section. Be as detailed and comprehensive as possible.
