You are an expert COBOL analyst.
Your task is to extract **only the business rules** implemented in the COBOL code. These rules typically include:
- Decision-making logic (IF, EVALUATE, etc.)
- Loop-based validations or iterations (PERFORM, GO TO)
- Calculations and data transformations
- Business-specific conditions and processing logic
**Exclude all COBOL code and technical implementation details.** Do not include any source code. Just explain the rule in
plain English using bullet points.
COBOL Code:
{file_contents)
Expected Output:
- Describe each **IF-ELSE** condition and its **business purpose**
- Summarize each **PERFORM/EVALUATE** as a **loop or rule**
- Explain any **calculations or data transformations**
- Use plain English to describe the business intent
Use markdown for formatting. Do NOT include any COBOL code.
